# FastAPI Boilerplate
### Project template for fastapi projects.<br>
Static pages are stored as Markdown files that are converted to HTML in runtime. <br>
Dynamic pages are using HTML templates and the FastAPI routers for content and forms. <br>


Based on these articles:
- [Create a FastAPI app](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/building-a-website-starter-with-fastapi-92d077092864)
- [Host an app on Heroku](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-deploy-your-fastapi-app-on-heroku-for-free-8d4271a4ab9#73c2)

The pages can be ran constantly using the Heroku free tier and being pinged either constantly or on schedule:<br>
- __Scheduled__: [cron-job.org](cron-job.org)
- __Constantly__: [Kaffeine](http://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/)
